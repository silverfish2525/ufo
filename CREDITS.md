# Credits

`better-ufo` is a fork of [`unjs/ufo`](https://github.com/unjs/ufo)
by Pooya Parsa (@pi0) and the unjs contributors. See
[LICENSE](./LICENSE) for the upstream MIT copyright — this fork
inherits and preserves it.

## Adopted upstream work

The following upstream pull requests and issues from `unjs/ufo` were
incorporated into this fork, sometimes verbatim, sometimes reworked
to converge conflicting proposals against the WHATWG URL spec.
Every entry below has a matching cite in the source tree.

### Performance

- **@saripovdenis** —
  PR [#331](https://github.com/unjs/ufo/pull/331) (`parseQuery`
  charCode-scan rewrite, ~40% faster on real-world benchmarks),
  PR [#333](https://github.com/unjs/ufo/pull/333) (`stringifyQuery`
  single-pass string builder).
  Cite: `src/query.ts` (`parseQuery`, `stringifyQuery`).

### Security

- **@pi0** — PR [#289](https://github.com/unjs/ufo/pull/289)
  (`__proto__` / `constructor` guard for `getQuery` / `parseQuery`).
  Cite: `src/query.ts` (dangerous-key filter).
- **@spokodev** — PR [#355](https://github.com/unjs/ufo/pull/355)
  (empty-key `parseQuery` correctness fix — `=value` now round-trips
  as `{ "": "value" }` instead of silently losing the value).
  Cite: `src/query.ts` (empty-key branch).

### Encoding — WHATWG `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` compliance

Eleven overlapping community PRs proposed fixes to `encodeQueryValue`
/ `encodeQueryKey`. `better-ufo` converged them into a single
spec-aligned implementation (encode set drawn from
[WHATWG URL §5](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#percent-encoded-bytes)).
Cite: `src/encoding.ts` (top-of-file rationale block).

### Bug fixes

  and preserves the host slot).
  Cite: `src/utils/protocol.ts`.
